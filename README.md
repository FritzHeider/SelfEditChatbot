# SelfEditChatbot
 SelfEditChatbot is an intelligent conversational agent powered by a cognitive model inspired by Freudian psychology. It incorporates self-editing mechanisms, sentiment analysis, and adaptive learning to engage in meaningful and dynamic conversations with users. The project leverages natural language processing libraries and machine learning techniques to enhance the chatbot's understanding, responsiveness, and adaptability. Join us in exploring the fascinating world of self-editing chatbots and advancing the frontier of conversational AI.    


In this skeleton code:

The Preprocessor class tokenizes and preprocesses text data using NLTK.
The SentimentAnalyzer class performs sentiment analysis using NLTK's VADER sentiment analysis tool.
The DialogueManager class manages the conversation flow and tracks conversation context.
The LearningAgent class handles learning and adaptation based on user feedback and chatbot responses.
The Web Service module deploys the chatbot as a web service using Flask, allowing users to interact with it through HTTP requests.
You can extend and customize each class according to your specific requirements and integrate additional functionality as needed.
